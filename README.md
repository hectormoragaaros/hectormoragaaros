<p>ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @hectormoragaaros, an IT speciallist that has been working in several aspects of the IT world since 2004. My current interests are the Java language, Web development and the Spring IDE.</p>
<p>Currently all the projects you'll find in this repository are part of my interests in learning and practicing the Spring IDE with some specific problems. You'll also find my Ms. Cs. Thesis research (soon).</p>
<p>I like some maths problems (as a hobby ðŸ¤“). Currently I'm solving some problems of <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler .Net</a>. I'm in the number 65. 
<p>Finally, but not the least important, there are some projects that are the practice of my learning courses from Udemy, coursera, etc.</p>
